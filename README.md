## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've been practicing HTML5 & CSS, but I wanted to challenge myself to see if I could build a simple QR code layout with Flexbox. The use of git and github was also solidified in this project. This is the first project I pushed on to github requiring the uses of push, branches, and clone. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.columns {
     display: flex;
     flex-direction: column;
     justify-content: center;
     align-items: center;
     text-align: center; 
     border-radius: 1rem;
     gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

CSS is something I will continue to practice. There are so many neat tricks that you could do with CSS without the use of Javascript. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Positioning](https://learnlayout.com/flexbox.html) - This helped me for align all the items in the qr code.
